## Dear Maarten,

I'm sorry, but I was not thoughtful and took your time!

I recently studied Polkadot’s official tutorial. When I deploy a smart contract on a local node, the operation of the contract is normal, but I ran into problems with Plasm or online deployment. As shown in the picture ([pic1](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/752022746153615361/799528698931052564/unknown.png), [pic2](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/752022746153615361/799528747040505896/unknown.png)), Contract address is `G4FWcBLDsqgV9s2jhitixzJ8xnxhLQN3qdqhd4VWg3GZBT7`, a development friend of mine I also encountered the same problem. Please help me to see what caused it.

It took up your precious time, thank you very much!

I am a blockchain development engineer, my name is Yang Xinmin, and I currently work in Changsha, Hunan, China. I have been doing this work for some years, and I have experience in Ethereum smart contract development.

I would like to congratulate you on the initial success of your project, and I wish Plasm smoothly to receive the Polkadot mainnet!

Welcome to visit Changsha, China.

Best wishes for you!

People who want to be friends with you:
Yang Xinmin
